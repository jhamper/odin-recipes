    <p>A tasty meal that can be prepped a few days ahead of time, so you can throw it all together for a fast 5-minute lunch. For a cheaper, fresher version, try preparing everything at home. Serve with your favorite store-bought peanut sauce.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li> salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li> 1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
      <li> 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 small head lettuce leaves, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 large flour tortillas</li>
      <li>3 carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks</li>
      <li> 1 roasted red bell pepper, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Place chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap on a solid, level surface covered with a towel to minimize noise. Pound chicken flat using the smooth side of a meat mallet.</li>
      <li>Heat a grill pan to medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>Place chicken on the hot grill pan; season lightly with salt and pepper. Cook, covered, for 5 minutes. Flip and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Stir rice vinegar, cilantro, honey, lime juice, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl to make the dressing.</li>
      <li>Place chicken on a cutting board and chop into strips. Toss into the dressing.</li>
      <li>Lay a bed of lettuce onto each tortilla; add carrots and roasted red bell pepper. Top with chicken strips; drizzle lettuce with remaining dressing. Wrap tortilla around the filling. Repeat with remaining tortilla.</li>
    </ol>
